# KIRBY & BRIAN 2018

On October 27th, 2018, I got married to Kirby Robbins (now Kirby Yates)! Planning our wedding was a lot of work, but one of my favorite parts of planning was creating our wedding website from scratch with Ruby on Rails and jQuery. It's a little niftier than your run-of-the-mills wedding website - it features some Google Maps JavaScript API magic, and allows guests to submit RSVPs and post messages.
